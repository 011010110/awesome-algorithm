All the straight forward solution should work, but if the interviewer twists the question slightly 
by giving the difference array of prices, Ex: for ```{1, 7, 4, 11}```, if he gives ```{0, 6, -3, 7}```, 
you might end up being confused.

Here, the logic is to calculate the difference ```(maxCur += prices[i] - prices[i-1])```
of the original array, and find a contiguous subarray giving maximum profit. 
If the difference falls below ```0```, reset it to zero.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices:
            return 0
        res, max_cur = 0, 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            max_cur = max(0, max_cur+prices[i]-prices[i-1])
            res = max(res, max_cur)
        return res
```
