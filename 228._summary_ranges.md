Medium


Just collect the ranges, then format and return them.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def summaryRanges(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        ranges = []
        for i in nums:
            if not ranges or i > ranges[-1][-1] + 1:
                ranges += [],
            ranges[-1][1:] = i,
        return ['->'.join(map(str, r)) for r in ranges]                           
```
About the commas :-)

```
ranges += [],
r[1:] = n,
```
Why the trailing commas? Because it turns the right hand side into a tuple and I get the same effects as these more common alternatives:
```
ranges += [[]]
or
ranges.append([])

r[1:] = [n]
```
Without the comma, …

- ranges += [] wouldn’t add [] itself but only its elements, i.e., nothing.
- r[1:] = n wouldn’t work, because my n is not an iterable.

Why do it this way instead of the more common alternatives I showed above? Because it’s shorter and faster (according to tests I did a while back).
